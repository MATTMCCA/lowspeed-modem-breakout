(This IC dose have a transferable, Part 68 Registration. Since this board is not going to be evaluated for compliance, I advise you keep this puppy away from live phone lines.)

Hooking up unlicensed homebrew phone equipment is illegal, be smart, [just go buy a modem](https://www.newegg.com/p/2Z4-025W-02BE7).
